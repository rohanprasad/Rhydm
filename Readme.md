This is my first attempt to a customised Android music player.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Currently nothing is configured or working.
=======

Currently the app does a manual seach for '.mp3' files in the storage and adds them to a list.
It can play and pause the listed music files and move to next ones. Just the basic stuff.
Seekbar is currently not working.
